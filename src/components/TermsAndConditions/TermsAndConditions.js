                        Wheelz Finance is a Broker and not a Lender. This means that we offer finance from a limited range of lenders. As part of our process, we will introduce you to the lenders we work with and the financial products they offer. We act as the agent for this introduction and not as an independent financial advisor. However, we will ensure that you are aware of the features, benefits and exclusions so that you can be fully informed to make your choice. ​
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We will typically receive a commission from the lender which will either be a fixed fee or a fixed percentage of the amount you borrow. If you decide to purchase finance, we arrange this for you free of charge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For your reassurance, all of the lenders we work with could pay commission at different rates but the commission we receive does not influence the rate you will pay.
